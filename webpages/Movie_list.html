 <p>For the month of August a went back in time and binge watch some past favorites and one new movie</p>
<p> "Gilliverse" is a franchise created by American filmmaker Vince Gilligan, primarily based on the television series Breaking Bad,
its prequel/sequel series Better Call Saul, and its sequel film El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Breaking Bad revolves around chemistry teacher turned-methamphetamine drug lord Walter White (Bryan Cranston) 
        and his former student and fellow cook/dealer Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul). </li>
</ul>
<p>-I absolutely enjoy the series. Alto Walter loves to play mind game and often the "victim" the cast was terrific 
    from bigening to end</p>
 <center><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com" target="_blank"><h3>Better call Saul</h3></a></p></center>

 <ul>
    <li>Better Call Saul follows the past lives of criminal lawyer Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk),
        when he was a modest lawyer named Jimmy McGill, and of former cop-turned-hitman Michael Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks). </li>
</ul>
<p>-My kinda of lawyer! when you think of actors that would be perfect for a role, Bob Odenkirk was deffinitly the perfect fit for 
    Better call Saul"</p>
 <center><p><a href="https://www.netflix.com" target="_blank"><h3>El Camino</h3></a></p></center>
 <center><p>&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;</p></center>
 <ul>
    <li>El Camino focuses on Jesse after the events of the Breaking Bad finale. Gilligan believed all three works could be seen 
        independently from one another, but existed in the same framework and needed to be viewed together to receive the full experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>-Jesse will alway be Jesse! Bad person with a heart of gold!</p>
<p>The three works are about the topic of change and metamorphosis, with the protagonists drastically changing as their stories develop:
     Walter White becoming Heisenberg for Breaking Bad, James McGill becoming Saul Goodman for Better Call Saul. Although he does not 
     acquire an alias, Better Call Saul also shows how Michael Ehrmantraut "breaks bad" by showing his transformation from a beat cop 
     in Philadelphia to Gustavo Fring's number one hitman. The shows and film are set in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The franchise is owned 
     by Sony Pictures Television and has garnered numerous awards for Breaking Bad, for Better Call Saul, and for El Camino. 
     The two series originally aired on AMC, while the film premiered on Netflix. They were produced at Albuquerque Studios which 
     emboldened success for the media in Albuquerque and film in New Mexico.</p>
